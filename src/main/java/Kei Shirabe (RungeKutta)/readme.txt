CS 131 LE3 programming part

Assigned programming parts were RK4 and RK4 for system of ODEs. I've decided
to put both into one program, and you can choose which one you want
to use.

User is asked for all relevant equations and variables, and output is
vector of x coordinate points
vector of y coordinate points
vector of t coordinate points if system of ODEs

IMPORTANT: PLEASE DO NOT PUT SPACES WHEN INPUTTING THE EQUATION
For some reason, that generates an error hahaha
