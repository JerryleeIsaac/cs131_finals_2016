How to use?
First make two text files namely Function and Derivative where you will your function and its derivative respectively
NOTE: In putting a function/derivative, if  you have have exponential, it is better if you separate the multiplication unless it is very large.
NOTE 2: If your input is a constant, add .0 at the end to make it a Double
After doing so, you can run the code already.
Upon running, the program will ask the following:
1. Your estimated solution to the problem
2. The number of maximum possible errors
3. Maximum number of iterations.

Then all you have to do is to wait for the program to finish printing the estimated values per iteration.

(PS) The main function file (.java) and the input getter file are in a separate classes.
Example:
Function.txt has (x*x*x)-3
and Derivative Function has (3*x*x)
Initial solution = 0.6
Maximum Error = 0.000001
Iterations = 5
